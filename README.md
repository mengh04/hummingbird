## Building
For more detailed instructions, see the [Building](docs/building.md) documentation.

```sh
# install relevant devel packages for xcb-common, x11, wayland, openssl, and pulseaudio if on Linux
git clone https://github.com/143mailliw/hummingbird
cd hummingbird

# last.fm api keys must be set in the environment for scrobbling to work
# these can be obtained from https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
# you can also set these in a .env file in the root of the project
#
# Hummingbird will still build without these keys, but scrobbling will be disabled
export LASTFM_API_KEY="your key"
export LASTFM_API_SECRET="your secret"

# debug mode will result in noticable slowdown in some cases
cargo build --release
```
